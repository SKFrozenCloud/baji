# Welcome

In this scenario, you will learn how to integrate Terraform and Infracost into a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. You will also learn how to  modify Terraform configurations to see how Infracost's cost estimates change.

# Motivation

Integrating Infracost into your CI/CD pipeline supports DevOps by providing cost visibility early in development, helping teams automate cost management and make informed decisions. This aligns with DevOps goals of automation, transparency, and continuous improvement in infrastructure management.

# Background

Infracost is an open-source tool that helps developers estimate cloud infrastructure costs directly in their development workflows. Integrating Infracost into a CI/CD pipeline enables teams to get real-time cost feedback when changes are proposed to infrastructure-as-code (IaC) such as Terraform. This tutorial will guide users through the steps required to set up Infracost within their CI/CD environment, ensuring that cost implications of infrastructure changes are visible during the development process, thereby promoting cost-aware engineering and reducing unexpected cloud expenses.

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool that enables developers to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure using declarative configuration files. It supports multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, allowing teams to automate the creation and management of their infrastructure in a consistent, version-controlled manner. By writing infrastructure code in Terraform, teams can easily scale, update, and replicate resources across different environments.

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that automates tasks within the software development lifecycle. It allows developers to define workflows that are triggered by specific events in a GitHub repository, such as a push, pull request, or release. With GitHub Actions, teams can automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code, integrating tools like Infracost to gain insights into cloud costs alongside other continuous integration and deployment tasks.
