### Step 6: Additional Integrations and Features

Here are some additional features and ways to extend this workflow:
- **Pull Request Review**: Configure the pipeline to post cost estimates directly on PRs.
- **Slack Notifications**: Use the Slack integration to notify your team about cost changes.
- **Cost Policies**: Set budget thresholds to block merges if infrastructure changes exceed a certain cost.

These features enhance the workflow by providing more control and visibility into infrastructure costs.
